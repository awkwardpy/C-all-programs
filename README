To use the C programs I provided, follow these general steps:

1. **Install a C Compiler:**
   Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Popular choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Linux and Code::Blocks or Dev-C++ for Windows.

2. **Write the Code:**
   Create a new C source code file (with a `.c` extension) using a code editor of your choice.

3. **Copy and Paste Code:**
   Copy the C code from the provided examples above and paste it into your code editor.

4. **Save the File:**
   Save the file with a meaningful name and the `.c` extension (e.g., `program.c`).

5. **Compile the Program:**
   Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the C file. Compile the program using the appropriate compiler command. For example, with GCC on Linux:

   ```
   gcc program.c -o program
   ```

   This command compiles `program.c` and generates an executable file named `program`.

6. **Run the Program:**
   Execute the compiled program:

   - On Linux, use `./program` (replace "program" with your program's name).
   - On Windows, double-click the executable file or run it from the command prompt.

7. **Follow Program Instructions:**
   If the program requires user input, follow the on-screen instructions and provide the necessary input.

8. **View Output:**
   The program will execute and display the output in the console or terminal.

9. **Modify and Experiment:**
   Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different inputs or customize the program to suit your needs.

10. **Save and Share:**
    Save your code and its output as needed. You can also share your code with others by providing them with the source code file.

Remember that the specific steps may vary depending on your development environment and operating system. Additionally, some programs may require additional libraries or dependencies, so be sure to read any documentation or comments within the code to understand their requirements.
