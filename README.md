# C-all-programs

Welcome to the C Programs Repository! This repository contains various C programs for educational and learning purposes. Below are instructions on how to compile and run these programs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC for Linux)
- Code Editor (optional)

## Running the Programs

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awkwardpy/C-all-programs.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Program Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd C_All_Programs
   ```

3. **Compile a Program:**

   To compile a specific program, use the C compiler. For example, to compile `program.c`:

   ```bash
   gcc All_c_programs.c -o All_c_programs
   ```

4. **Run the Compiled Program:**

   Execute the compiled program:

   - On Linux, use `./program` (replace "program" with the program's name).
   - On Windows, double-click the executable file or run it from the command prompt.

5. **Follow Program Instructions:**

   If the program requires user input, follow the on-screen instructions and provide the necessary input.

6. **View Program Output:**

   The program will execute and display the output in the console or terminal.

7. **Modify and Experiment:**

   Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different inputs or customize the program to suit your needs.

8. **Save and Share:**

   Save your code and its output as needed. You can also share your code with others by providing them with the source code file.
